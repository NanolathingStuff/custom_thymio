# custom_thymio
robotic's project 2021

read README.txt for instructions

This proposal of a project is about testing performances of different controllers studied in class regarding the Thymio robot, using a custom version of it in order to collect data andt in the end, show the elaborate results. The simulation will be done on ROS VM in a custom world representing a circuit and make the Thymio move in there.

The controllers tested will be:

    Open loop controller 
    Bang-bang controller
    Proportional controller 
    Derivative controller 
    PID controller
